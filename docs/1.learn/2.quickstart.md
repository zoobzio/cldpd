# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Docker (daemon running)

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/zoobzio/cldpd/cmd/cldpd@latest
```

Verify Docker is available:

```bash
docker info
```

## Create a Pod

A pod is a directory under `~/.cldpd/pods/` containing a Dockerfile and an optional `pod.json`.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cldpd/pods/myrepo
```

Write a Dockerfile that sets up the environment your repository needs:

```dockerfile
# ~/.cldpd/pods/myrepo/Dockerfile
FROM node:20

# Install Claude Code
RUN npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Clone the repository
RUN git clone https://github.com/org/repo.git /workspace
WORKDIR /workspace
```

The Dockerfile is entirely yours. cldpd builds it and runs it -- what goes inside is your decision.

## Configure (Optional)

Create `pod.json` to pass environment variables or override defaults:

```json
{
  "inheritEnv": ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "GITHUB_TOKEN"],
  "workdir": "/workspace"
}
```

`inheritEnv` forwards host environment variables to the container without writing them to disk. You can also set values directly with `env`, add bind mounts with `mounts`, or override the image tag with `image`. All fields are optional. If `pod.json` is absent, cldpd uses sensible defaults.

## Dispatch

Point the pod at a GitHub issue:

```bash
cldpd start myrepo --issue https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42
```

cldpd will:

1. Build the Docker image (tagged `cldpd-myrepo`)
2. Start a container with a unique session ID (e.g., `myrepo-a1b2c3d4`)
3. Run `claude -p "Work on this GitHub issue: <url>"` inside the container
4. Stream typed events to your terminal -- lifecycle transitions and output content
5. Exit with the container's exit code when the task completes

The container uses `--rm` and cleans up automatically on exit. Ctrl+C triggers graceful shutdown (SIGTERM with a 10-second timeout).

## Send Follow-Up Guidance

While the container is running, open a second terminal:

```bash
cldpd resume myrepo --prompt "Focus on the error handling in api.go"
```

This runs `claude --resume` inside the existing container. If the container has already exited, resume fails with a clear error.

## What Happens Inside

cldpd does not manage what happens inside the container. The repository's `.claude/` directory defines agent workflows, standing orders, and skills. Claude Code reads these and works the issue autonomously. The team leader narrates progress to stdout, which cldpd relays to your terminal.

Completed work appears on GitHub: pull requests, commits, issue comments. cldpd is the dispatch mechanism, not the orchestrator.
