# Overview

cldpd is an async pod lifecycle library for Claude Code agent teams. You define pods -- directories with a Dockerfile and optional configuration -- and cldpd handles image building, container lifecycle, and event streaming. The repositories inside the containers carry their own agent workflows. cldpd dispatches work, returns a session handle, and relays typed events back to the caller.

## The Idea

Every zoobzio repository already knows how to work. It has standing orders, agent definitions, and skills baked into its `.claude/` directory. What it needs is a way to be activated -- pointed at a GitHub issue and left to work autonomously inside an isolated environment.

cldpd is that activation mechanism. It is not an orchestrator. It does not manage agents or parse their output. It builds a container, starts Claude Code inside it, and streams typed lifecycle events back to the caller.

## The Implementation

- **Pod discovery** -- Finds pod definitions at `~/.cldpd/pods/<name>/`, validates Dockerfile presence, parses optional `pod.json` configuration
- **Image building** -- Builds Docker images from user-provided Dockerfiles via `docker build`
- **Session lifecycle** -- `Start` returns a `*Session` immediately after the build. The container runs in a background goroutine with a unique session ID (`<podName>-<hex8>`)
- **Event streaming** -- Typed events (`EventBuildStarted`, `EventOutput`, `EventContainerExited`, etc.) delivered over a buffered channel
- **Credential passthrough** -- Host environment variables and bind mounts forwarded to containers via Docker CLI flags
- **Graceful shutdown** -- `Session.Stop` sends SIGTERM with a configurable timeout, then SIGKILL
- **Session resume** -- Follow-up commands to running containers via `docker exec`, returning a new `*Session`
- **CLI** -- Two subcommands (`start`, `resume`) that consume session events until the container exits

## What It Enables

- Point any zoobzio repository at a GitHub issue and let its crew work autonomously
- Monitor progress in real time via typed lifecycle and output events
- Send follow-up guidance without interrupting the workflow
- Stop sessions gracefully with SIGTERM before SIGKILL
- Forward host credentials without writing secrets to disk
- Find completed work (PRs, commits, issue comments) on GitHub when the task finishes
