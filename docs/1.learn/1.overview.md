# Overview

cldpd dispatches work to Docker containers running Claude Code. You define pods -- directories with a Dockerfile and optional configuration -- and cldpd handles image building, container lifecycle, and output streaming. The repositories inside the containers carry their own agent workflows. cldpd just gets them running and relays what they say.

## The Idea

Every zoobzio repository already knows how to work. It has standing orders, agent definitions, and skills baked into its `.claude/` directory. What it needs is a way to be activated -- pointed at a GitHub issue and left to work autonomously inside an isolated environment.

cldpd is that activation mechanism. It is not an orchestrator. It does not manage agents or parse their output. It builds a container, starts Claude Code inside it, and streams the team leader's narration back to the caller.

## The Implementation

- **Pod discovery** -- Finds pod definitions at `~/.cldpd/pods/<name>/`, validates Dockerfile presence, parses optional `pod.json` configuration
- **Image building** -- Builds Docker images from user-provided Dockerfiles via `docker build`
- **Container lifecycle** -- Starts containers with deterministic names (`cldpd-<podname>`), runs Claude Code headlessly with a prompt, and cleans up on exit
- **Output streaming** -- Direct pass-through of container stdout to the caller, no buffering or transformation
- **Session resume** -- Follow-up commands to running containers via `docker exec` in a second terminal
- **CLI** -- Two subcommands (`start`, `resume`) that block for the duration of the run

## What It Enables

- Point any zoobzio repository at a GitHub issue and let its crew work autonomously
- Monitor progress in real time via the team leader's output stream
- Send follow-up guidance without interrupting the workflow
- Find completed work (PRs, commits, issue comments) on GitHub when the task finishes
